ATTENTION:  
1.  If lamda and m all are integers, then lamda/m is also a integer instead of a float, for exmple the result  1/2 is 0 instead of 0.5!!!!!!. YOU MUST BE CAREFUL WITH THIS. When  computed derivative of cost funtion i use fowllowing formula:
    deri = (x.T * error)/m + (lamda/m)*theta
obviously, it is wrong when lamda and m is integer.

2. when you chose learning rate alpha, you'd better 0.3 0.03 and 0.9 0.09 and so on

3. it will run faster if just use np.narray to do computation instead of np.matrix

4.  define a function as following :
    def change(data):
       data[0,0] = 10

    if one is a 3*3 matrix, and if we call the function, and we will find the a[0,0] has been changed to 10
